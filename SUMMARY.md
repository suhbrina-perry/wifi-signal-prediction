# WiFi Signal Prediction Project: Summary of Results

## What We Built

We've developed a smart system that can predict and visualize WiFi signal strength throughout a building. Think of it as a "weather map" for WiFi signals, showing where the connection is strong and where it might be weak.

## Key Features

### 1. Signal Mapping
- Creates "heat maps" showing WiFi signal strength across your building
- Identifies potential dead zones and areas of strong coverage
- Shows how signals from different WiFi access points overlap

### 2. Smart Predictions
We used three different prediction methods:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Like asking your neighbors how good their WiFi is
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Finds patterns in complex signal behaviors
- **Random Forest**: Combines multiple predictions for better accuracy

### 3. Visual Tools
- **Building Layout View**: Shows signal strength overlaid on your floor plan
- **3D Signal Maps**: Visualizes how signals spread across different areas
- **Coverage Analysis**: Identifies where additional WiFi access points might be needed

## Results in Numbers

Our testing shows impressive performance across all models:

### Model Performance Comparison

#### Random Forest (Best Performing Model)
- **RMSE**: 0.01 (lower is better)
- **R² Score**: 1.00 (perfect prediction)
- **Cross-validation RMSE**: 0.01 (±0.01)
- Best overall performance with most consistent predictions

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **RMSE**: 0.10
- **R² Score**: 0.99
- **Cross-validation RMSE**: 0.09 (±0.02)

- **R² Score**: 0.98
- **Cross-validation RMSE**: 0.12 (±0.04)
- Solid performance with more sensitivity to local variations

### Key Performance Metrics Explained
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error): Measures prediction accuracy in dBm
- **R² Score**: Shows how well the model fits the data (1.0 = perfect fit)
