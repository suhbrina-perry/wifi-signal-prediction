Slide 4: System Performance & Visualization

1. System Performance
• Grid Resolution: 0.1m (10cm)
• Sampling Points: 200x120 grid (24,000 points)
• Coverage Area: 50m x 30m (1,500 m²)
• Signal Range: Typically -30 dBm to -90 dBm

2. Visualization Improvements
• AP Marker Size: 3000-4000 units
• High-Resolution Output: 600 DPI
• Material Overlay: 0.5 alpha transparency
• Support for Multiple APs (up to 4)
  - Channel Separation: 5 channels
  - Realistic Noise: σ = 2 dB
